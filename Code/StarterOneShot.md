# Mount Hyhelm
- People have been going missing lately (players can figure out only men are missing). The mayor's wife had died. He was so lonely that he made a summoning ritual for a succubus with a hermit in the mountains. Turns out the succubus summoned was a Namtar - a naga demon (alternatives - mammoth woman, scorpion woman, crocodile woman). He rejected her beacuse she was a monster, so she went up the mountain, and she threatened she needs to feed and will start doing that soon. So the Namtar Succubus started to entice, kidnap and devour men of the town.
The story starts with the mayor asking the players for help with figuring out where the people are gone. There are several tell-tale signs:
    - The missing people are always ones who go up the mountain sometimes: pilgrim, hunter, etc. They went up there and never came back. Even guards are afraid to step away.
    - There are footprints in the snow leading away from the village, along with some marks as if "something was dragged on the ground, in a rounded zig-zag pattern".
    - There is a hermit living in the mountains and she is into occultism

## How to read it
## Story Breakdown
## Special Rules





## Road to Farwood
Traveling on the road to Farwood. See the mountaintops in the distace, touching the clouds.
Check for orientation.
> Players encounter a collapsed ground due to an avalanche (Checks and game desfashoration)
Players get to Farwood as the sun is going down.





## Farwood
Reach Farwood (describe architecture -- Busteni or Sinaia) (houses of dark spruce wood, smoke, BBQ, some guards).
Players walk right into the marketplace. On the more rear end, up the slope, players can see a larger building.
> People mentioning the light on the mountain
Ask players "What do you do now?" (they could go to the Mayor directly, ask for directions, ask a guard)




## Farwood: Mayor
...Dwiddling his ring finger
> Have you ever been to Farwood at night? It is a picturesque environment.
> [Goes to the window, getting late at night] That thing [mayor points to the light on the mountain]. That light has been there for months... nobody managed to reach it. And several people tried, though none returned.
> Not long ago, the light was shining brighter. But lately, it's dimmed. It seems as if the light has quieted down...
> Because something else started to happen when the light dimmed down. People of Farwood have been disappearing. A strange coincidence, do you reckon? Now, what if the two are correlated. What if the missing people and the dimming down of the light are related?
> I want you to go up the mountain. First and foremost, find out who or what is messing with the people and deal with the problem. Second, I want to know what that light is, and if it's dangerous, deal with it.
Mayor makes a head gesture to his guard, who throws you a bag.
> 300 gold upfront. 700 more when you're done. Get whatever supplies you need.
> There is a road through the forest, leading up the mountain. After a certain point, you will need to improvise your way up.

> ...people who disappeared? In the past few weeks we have 3 men who were never seen again, and a woman. We believe they all went up the mountain. Ask the townnsfolk around Farwood or in the tavern.
> ...their families? Sure...
> ...My wife, Rilda? I haven't told you this, perhaps I should have. I don't know where she is. Up the mountain, I hope you may at least find her body. It's where she went, alone, and we could not find her [somewhat true, they found a monster and have a suspicion it was her].
> ...Rilda being sick? She had a disease... we tried the cleric and doctors, but they couldn't do much. She wanted to see the hermit in the mountains. I didn't think it was a good idea. She went alone, at night, when I was asleep.




## Farwood Tavern
> Eeey! Welcome, welcome! Have a seat. Food? Drinks? What can I get ye?
> You talked to the mayor, huh? He can seem pretty rough. Poor bastard's never been the same since his wife's vanished, a few months back. Doesn't wanna talk about it. We all know damn well that's the main reason he hired you guys... to find his wife. Didn't tell you about it, huh?
> You know, there's a hermit living up the mountain. Goes by the name of Hail. Nobody knows much about Hail, but if you're looking for a troublemaker, that's your lead.
> ...The mountain trail? Expect some 2, maybe even 3 days hike to the top. Be prepared.
> ...People who disappeared? A hunter, Stok, went into the forest, never returned. We also have a missing camper, he goes hiking several times a year - this time, he never came back. Finally, there was a pilgrim. An old man at that, went up the road to a shrine he visits every week. And, of course, the mayor's wife.
> ...The hunter, Stok? Aye, went after moose or boar most likely, one week ago. Fine dwarf. Does all he can to provide for his family.
> ...The hiker, Triny? A gnome hiker. Likes to find berries and catch birds and all. Lived alone in the tavern, making coin off of his flute singing shows. Went missing like 2 or so weeks ago.
> ...The pilgrim, Wonnen? Old elf, was the main cleric of our temple. He was what we call a "generic priest". Knew about all sorts of religions, tended to all. A jack of all trades. Now only his apprentice is at the temple. Wonnen was reported missing just 2 days ago.
> ...The light? It's been there for like a year, give or take. Couldn't tell you more about it.
> ...The light dimmed? Oh... I never really noticed it. Yeah, you're right! I think it is dimmer! Huh...
> ...Mayor's wife? Rilda was her name. Rumor has it she went to investigate the light herself, and never came back. This was, oh, some weeks ago, I think?
> ...The hermit, Hail? I wish I knew more, but I don't. Lives in the mountains, past the cleric's shrine.
> ...People investigatig the light? There have been attempts, over the year. None came back.


## Farwood Marketplace
> ...The mountain? Make sure you're well prepared for the cold and for camping!
> ...People who disappeared? Let's see... we have the mayor's wife, Rilda, Wonnen the town's cleric [elf], Stok the hunter [dwarf] and Triny the hiker [gnome], if I recall correctly.
> ...The hunter, Stok? Used to trade meat and hides. He just went hunting one day, and poof! Never seen again! Now we're stuck eating carrots and lettuce!
> ...The hiker, Triny? Some transient - a hobo. Nobody liked him. Always begging for money. Glad he's not here anymore, frankly.
> ...The pilgrim, Wonnen? Well, holy damn, we miss him gravely! There's a shrine up in the mountains he used to go to pray. If you go out, look for him there! It's right on the trail through the forest, you can't miss it.
> ...The light? Hehe, well lo and behold! It's our town's touristic attraction! Reckon we can make some coin off of it hehe. Been there all year! Some say it's a fiend or a demon or so. I don't know, it helps me fall asleep faster.
> ...The light dimmed? Yeah, it did! Few weeks ago. Hope it doesn't extinguish itself too soon!
> ...Mayor's wife, Rilda? Now that woman was something else! A beauty worth no one's eyes! Rumor has it she was slowly dying of a disease. Who knows if it's true. But my guys, let me tell you, she was drawn to that light like a moth to the flame. Curiosity killed the cat, I say!
> ...The hermit, Hail? She's freakin' insane! Into the occult and all. Rumor has it she summons demons and breathes fire. They say she was a villager of Farwood, back in the day, go figure! [spits] No villager I know that I'd let to summon demons, I tell ya! You wanna find her? Head up the mountain, past the shrine. She's more than a day's hike. I'd definitely start questioning her!
> ...People investigatig the light? People come and go. Huh, only men, now that I think about it. Never seen a woman try to get to that light, other than the mayor's wife. Well, as long as we didn't go too far up the mountain, we used to be safe here! Seems nowadays you can't even go for a stroll.




## Base of the Mountain
Players start going on the road. They see fauna.
Players walk for several hours, hiking. Not snowing.

Sense Check (8) to notice a blood drop on the snowy grass. They can track it a few hundred meters to find the corpse of someone -- the hunter.
He seemed covered in snow, but now seems 
It appears as if he was partially eaten, by small bite marks. There are also a lot of small holes in his clothes. There are no other trails except (Sense Check) some small holes in the ground and a sort of dust around.

Returning to the road, players eventually reach the shrine -- there are no sigs of the cleric.
A Sense Check will reveal an effigy. If getting too close to the effigy, players are ambushed.


### Combat
- Hawkmoth: Attacks apply a poison of a color. If you get hit twice by the same color Hawkmoth, you take damage and are Blinded.
- Moonfire Spirit: Its attacks heal an ally

    Encounter: Mountain Base Moths
    Players             Enemies
    3                   1 Vampire Cultist, 2 Cultists 
    4                   1 Vampire Cultist, 3 Cultists
    5                   1 Vampire Cultist, 4 Cultists
    + Followers         Special (see description)

The hermit can be briefly seen.

## Mountain Path

Going ahead, there seem to be 2 roads. One has human tracks on the bridge. The other one has a different kind of tracks, as if someone or something shoved snow equally on all sides.

They can see the light more clearly now, and it's gettig darker.
If players make a fire, there will be moths coming to the flame.

Left goes to Broken Bridge
Right goes to the Dim Caverns

## Broken Bridge (Path 1)
Players follow the human tracks and eventually reach a broken bridge.
They catch a glimpse of Rilda (Sense levels).
Players can find a way to cross it.

On the other side, they find a corpse with snow on it. Upon closer inspection, it's not snow -- it's soft fur. This is Wonnen the cleric.
The corpse has some scribbled notes about fiends (not directly mentioning the light), and how some fiends need female hosts to reproduce.





## Rocky Pass (Path 2)
If players follow the strange tracks, they come across a butterfly nest.
They catch a glimpse of Rilda (Sense levels).
Players find the skeleton of a guard being eaten by moths (and moth coccoons growing on him). Players knew nothing of a missing guard.
Players also find a wedding ring, for a male. Quite a good one. It says "Rilda & Mayor" (it's the mayor's).





## Hermit
Players reach the hermit, who is staring at a ball of light.
> You have come! Begone! Light is not for you!
> What is it you seek? You want to take away my light! The light already dimmed! Oh, I miss it so much! It hurts, I need more light! I need more light!

> ...[If players approach the light] Mine! Stay away!

> ...Occult magic? Summoning demons? No, no, no, no! I simply live by the gift of the ever shining light. They all want to come to the light! No magic... just... light...
> ...The light on the mountain? It is alive! I was the first to find it, and it rewarded me with this beautiful form I have now! Drew me in... I couldn't resist. And staring it feels so good! But... I was not worthy enough.
> ...The light dimmed? I don't know precisely why. But it looks as if something is partially covering it or blocking it.
> ...Disappearing or dead people? Ah! The wife of the mayor is stalking her prey, luring them up the mountain with her beauty, and devouring them whole. She is one with the light on the mountain.
> ...Mayor's wife, Rilda? She came up the mountain - first woman to try to get to light. The light beckoned her, looking for a suitable female host. One who was already slowly dying... She came to me, seeking help. I showed her the light, and she was cured of her sickly body. She became one with the light. And now, she is beautiful, and attracts men out from the village to eat them. The light possessed her!
> ...Mayor's wife, Rilda, the moth? She is powerful - lures men up the moutain to their death. Dangerous, and beautiful. I sometimes fear. She is too powerful... and she made the light dim...
> ...Moths? I was the only moth! Now, they are multiplying! So many of them! And agressive! I fear...
> ...You want to get to the light? Ah... of course you do, everyone does. Like moths to the flame... but you shall meet your demise and you will perish.
> ...How to get to the light? (will require convincing) Take this path up the mountain, but beweare - Rilda and the light have their own protective spells, that I could not breach myself after she was possessed by the light.



## Road to the Lair
Puzzle





## Moth's Nest
The light is a fiend that manipulates the minds of people to come and investigate.
The light is now being surrounded by swarms of moths, making it dimmed.

The light normally kills all men, but since it is surrounded by moths, its effect is mitigated.

When fighting Rilda, players can occasioanlly see the light spirit's true form, which is a grotesque moth beast made of light that grows every turn.

> The mayor... he has seen us. The morning when the wife Rilda was transformed, he tried to climb up with the guards. One of those men we took as tribute, and devoured him to sprout new butterflies. The mayor was not happy with our new form. With respect for the mayor, we let him live.
> The swarm must grow, and feed. It is our nature. The nature of the queen of the moths.

Afterwards, they can find the hermit petrified and turned to ash, and all other giant moths the same.




## Ending
Mayor:
> Rilda? I saw the moth beast... I didn't believe it at first, that it was Rilda. But I saw it in her eye -- it was her.
> I had my suspicion that she was the one killing all the innocent men. That thing you killed... was an abomination. No wife of mine. You put her soul to rest, and that's what matters.
> ...Moth monsters? Ghosts? I did not know about them.

# Appendix


## Handouts

When one says "magical light", it is generally associated with something holy, a divine phenomenon. But from the moment I saw it, I knew that thing was by no means holy. Such events don't happen out of nowhere, certainly if correlated with disappearances.
Could it be a fiend? Such creatures usually have no explicable origin - they simply appear out of nowhere, and they are not spirits, nor demons or ghosts. They are often "parasites", and require hosts or  Some say fiends are summoned on rare phenomena, like lightning striking the same place twice, a flipped coin landing on its side, or an animal being birthed in an unusual location.
I shall continue my journey to the shrine. If perhaps I spot something peculiar, I will jot it down.
