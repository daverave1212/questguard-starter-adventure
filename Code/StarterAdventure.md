# Changes

## Currently:
A priest needs to be escorted to another village to replace the previous priest who disappeared mysteriously.
- He got this information through the church network
- He is unknowingly carrying a rosary with a cursed bead

## New:
A retired paladin wants to be escorted to another village to investigate the disappearance of a priest he studied with years ago.
- They usually exchange letters every year, but this year he got no response... from anyone. And I sent multiple letters. I fear something may have happened to him or the church.

# Characters

## Villain (Sedrik)
Villain is a vampire (previously occult investigator noble) cursed with 1000 curses by an it eldritch mage who tried to kill him for dabbling too deep in his affairs.
The only way to geetri of rses is to spread them, 1 by 1, to 1000 people.
Most people with these curses die.
The vampire only targets those who dabble in dark magic, as he has a deep hatred for warlocks and dark mages. 
To inflict curses, he has raised Dementors.
Once he is free of the curses, he will destroy all dementors.
### Nuances
- Some people want the curses themselves, either because they wanted to help, or because they are themselves dabbling into the occult. The vampire needs these people alive... is it a good compromise?
### Minions
- Cultists & Vampires
- Dementors & Undead
- 
### Villain (Mortessa)
Very frail eldritch mage, very devoid of power; she is immortal but his body keeps decaying as does her mind.
Other than wanting immortality, power, to destroy the vampire
- She wants to use a the eldritch artefacts to gain immortality and become an actual lich
- Her fight has a rounds timer, depending on the players' progress
### Minions
- Goblins
- Undead


# NPC's
- Sedrik Ashcroft (vampire)
- Mortessa Farell (lich)
- Ser Alan Johnson (retired paladin)
- Riven (Druid)

- "Chug" Ogcharug Orangescale (innkeeper, very fat dragonborn)
- Periwinkle Yee (merchant, bertle raccoon)
- Sylvaine Ebergail (bard)
- Boris Ironhand (blacksmith)

- Tony O'Connor (cult escapee)


# Writing the Adventure
#### Pre
"What players might do"
"This NPC has no notable secrets and is free to improvise"
"Skip If sections if they don't apply"
Props, resources and pics
#### Also
Whenever players arrive at a location, turn to the page for that location. Skim through the subtitles of the page to see which one fits for the players (e.g. "First time players arrive...", "If players have X item", etc).
If you don't understand what an "If..." section means, then it probably doesn't apply (e.g. "If Players Have Cursed Lamp")
Don't repeat the same read-aloud.
#### Repeating Rolls
No
#### NPC Lying
...NPC has a persuasion grade.
...if players want to make a roll, simply say:
- A: They are very difficult to read
- B:...
#### NPC Tips
Also, feel free to paraphrase them, but keep the intended meaning.
Don't worry if you don't understand what an NPC says. If you don't know about it, neither do the players.

E.g.: "**The Blue Lagoon**? I think that's north of here."
If an NPC has no lines about something, they don't know about it.
For S statements, start with the first and wait for a player response. If you can, keep the conversation going and bring up each S, in that order, one by one (order isn't usually important though). If players don't respond, say the next S. Repeat this again and again until you run out of S's for an NPC.

# Character Creation
If there is a Cleric / Paladin, tie Ser Alan.
*If there is a Druid, they heard rumors of Riven, and wish to meet them
If there is a Hunter, they heard rumors of a dragon
If there is a Mage, they sense a very feit, unusual magic in the air that you have never seen.
*If there is a Rogue, they heard of an abandoned mansion. It used to be a rich person's mansion - surely there is treasure still hidden there. Rogues know rich people hide riches inside armchair stuffing and underneath fake shelf bottoms.
If there is a Shaman, the spirits in the area are disturbed
*If there is a Warlock, had a calling for black magic artifacts in the area. Furthermore, you can sense breaches with the Shadow Realm - someone is using black magic to quickly travel between locations.
If there is a Warrior, they know about goblins terrorizing the townsfolk and there have been rumors of an ogre.
















# Locations Outline

## Road to Whispervale
**NEW**
Players meet Ser Alan Johnson: Nice to meet you, what are your names?
_Describe characters_
Players escort a priest Ser Alan to the Town, through a forest road. Once there, you will be paid 100g each, from the paladin's personal funds.
He tells them he is investigating a missing priest he studied with in the past - an old friend.
> I can do a bit of healing but my combat days are over. I haven't lifted a sword in years.
> Whispervale? It's a nice town. I've been there a few times, to visit my friend.
> Our religion? I am part of a branch of the Church of Solais, our god. We give thanks for the light of day and for the healing powers, and pray that Solais show us the path and light the way in our darkest times.
> I don't have a map of the area, but I do have a town map of Whispervale... here.
> Maybe the courier couldn't make it there or back... and if there are bandits roaming the roads, we'd best take care of them.

They are attacked by Shades. Players can describe where they got hit

    Encounter: Shades
    Players             Enemies
    3                   3 Shades
    4                   4 Shades
    5                   5 Shades

_Curse._
_Loot._


Players become cursed (he isn't able to cure it - this is black magic! I have never seen something so potent).
> When we're in town, I can look for a remedy in the church's stash...
> It is your choice - we can travel the night or camp until morning.
> There is... another option if you're the kind. People in town used to go a local druid who lives not far off from here. Name is Riven. It's a detour from our path, but... it's closer by than the town. I'd be careful though. I'm not a man of nature, I'd be cautious trusting any druidic remedy.
> I don't even know if it's a man or a woman. Never met Riven.





## Riven's Home
_If first time here..._
The Druid's house perimeter is trapped (_puzzle_).
Upon arrival, they realize they misused the pronoun - the Druid is actually a he. Riven refuses to help unless persuaded (gold? or smth else). He can take a look at the curse and give some info and offer a free potion. The curses are difficult to remove.
Shades are drawn to black magic - artefacts, things like that.
> I haven't seen the curse before. I've heard rumors about it, but...
> Why I live alone... a long time ago, I accidentally ate someone... I had a change in mind [partial truth]
> Town's folk? I've helped cure an ailment for Boris. Cat's fever. He lost a leg, but he was fine. Some other townsfolk too.
> Mortessa? Haven't heard of her. (lie)
> Sedrik? He used to be a noble a long time ago, correct?
> Black bead? Show me... I've seen these before, but I have no idea what they are (truth)

> Riven needs a lamp. A magical one. It protected the gravedigger from evil spirits. The old gravedigger had one (insert their relation).
> In return, I need a favor. Go to the mansion. The basement is magically locked with a password. The password is Farell. From there, bring me the crystal ball.

**If players got here after going to town, end of Adventure.**


What could Riven want players to do to help Mortessa?
- Find information about Sedrik's plans and location
- Retrieve an item to stop Sedrik










## Town
_When ariving in town..._
_In the distance, you can see a mansion... how many houses and people..._
**Reward: Once per chapter, players can come to Ser Alan and be healed for a fee of 50 gold.**
> I think you should rest. The tavern has good rooms. I will head directly to the temple. Feel free to come by.
> You can always come to me if you need guidance
Shopping. Hub. Tavern. Temple (can't cure curse).
List the full range of options the players have to visit.
> Map of town (given by Ser Alan... "oh, I found this! Thought I'd lost it!")_
Activities possible:
- Tavern (housing, rumors -- fishy temple quest, merchant Periwinkle -- goblin trouble)
- Temple (healing) (Dead Priest ❗)
- Blacksmith (Mansion ❗)
- Merchant Periwinkle (Goblins ❗) 
- Bard (Accordion ❗)

### If players have lamp...
Players meet someone else with the curse, trying to run away from a cult.
> I joined but its not like I thought... I had no one else
> They're all cursed
> They cursed me too
> ❗ They want to kidnap someone tomorrow at midnight to curse them. Please help!
> They follow Sedrik the vampire.
> Their base? I can take you there, yeah! But please, you have to stop them!










### Town: Tavern
Rumors (probably bartender).
> Those Shades have been attacking people. Been happening for a few weeks! They attacked the fisherman and a couple of guards on duty. Fisherman died of a strange mark, and the guard is gone.
> Rumors say whatever those Shades touch becomes cursed... I even heard rumors of a really big one, larger than the other. Makes my spine shiver!
> Tell you what, if you find anyone, let us know! I'm missing my waiter! (pseudoquest)
> ❗ Side Quest: There was something fishy going on in the church... they're hiding something
> ❗ Goblins are freakin stealing everything. See Periwinkle the merchant. I don't know what's gotten into them... They randomly started attacking, killing livestock and stealing!

> That curse mark! I've seen it before! The fisherman!

> Riven the druid? Cures minor diseases and helps out. Never met her... don't want to. Gives me a wicked feeling.
> Sylvaine the bard? Yeah she comes often. Drinks a lot too.
> Periwinkle the merchant? Short, big ears, long nose. Sells all sort of junk. [raccoon Bertle]
> Boris the blacksmith? Just downtown.
> Mayor Thumbson? I've written a note to him; feels like we need more protection lately...

#### If players have Felinar
Sedrik appears there. Don't scream.
- I need your help
I have something for you - Shackles. They can shackle an undead. I use something similar to bind the Shades to my control. You will need them if you go after Mortessa.











### Town: Town Square
Sylvaine needs her accordion back
> I need back a stolen accordion. Goblins stole it. I want it back.
> Oh it's magic and cursed for sure!
> But I've never used it! Will I? Maybe...
> I don't have money to pay you... I'll give you a family heirloom though.
> Goblins steal everything! From me and from everyone in town!
❗ Find the goblin hideout and get the accordion. I will reward you with one of my family's heirlooms, and perhaps I'll show you about a secret project of mine in the forest that I think you'll like.
When you are ready to go, I will come with (escort quest). I know where their hideout is - if you can show me a map.
❕ Do you have a map? Periwinkle the merchant sells maps for quite cheap.
_Knows nothing of: Riven, Mortessa, Sedrik, the Curses._









### Town: Blacksmith:
> A guy came to me with this dagger and asked me to destroy it a few days back.
> Seems like a fine craft - don't know why anyone would destroy it.
> Definitely cursed though if you ask me!
> Of course I didn't destroy it! Ye want it? 350 gold and it's yours.

> Named Loc-? Yeah I think I know where it is...










### Town: Merchant (or Mayor)
Mayor of town might want to know who the adventurers are.
Players find out about the abandoned mansion of a noble... who used to live there exactly some 200 years ago.

> Maybe one day I'll gather enough money to buy that mansion... it's very creepy though.
- Looted and pillaged
- Nobody wants to buy it
- Lord Sedrik was the name of the owner, rumor has it the owner killed everyone he knew and fled the town. Why? I couldn't tell you
- It's definitely haunted
- Definitely don't go there if you're not well equipped

> Oh, yes, goblins stole much from me! I'll give you a list of things. I'll pay 40g for each item recovered!

> Named Loc-? Yeah I think I know where it is...
_Knows... nothing else of importance, really. He's just a merchant._








### Town: Temple (❗)
Puzzle.
Looking deeper into the church basement (trapped), players can find an old altar, with candles and... a dead ex-priest. With several tattoos.
Upon inspection, the tattoos are slowly steaming and disappearing.
They also find his journal, detailing how the cult promised him money and protection from the spirits for each curse. On the last day, he met Sedrik which is full of tattoos and curses. It vaguely describes him transferring curses to him and asking him "are you sure?".
Rumors are the curses can provide special "protection" agains the aging magic, but he hasn't figured out yet what that means. If only he had more curses upon him and he could handle them...
**Reward:** Once per chapter, players can come to Ser Alan and be healed **for free**.
_Rose petals_

#### If 3 days have passed...
Someone came to the temple to seek help today. She died before my eyes. Then her curse started to evaporate into thin air...
She claims many people with these curses die. Only certain blood types can bear the curse.

#### Ser Alan Confrontation (❗)
If heavily pressed, Ser Alan is keeping a strange **black bead**. Obviously cursed.
He reveals when praying on the rosary, he had a waking dream. It was the town of Whispervale, and the voice of an old woman.








### Town: Fisherman
Players can find out that the fisherman had a dagger he used to skin fish with.
As he was dying, he told me he destroyed it. That dagger always made me feel nauseous.
She knows nothing more. Feel free to improvise non-important details.

### Town: Guards (Outskirts)
I couldn't tell you what happened. We were just attacked. I hid in a wheelbarrow, and Tony was gone!
He knows nothing more. Feel free to improvise non-important details.








## The Kidnapping (❗)
Players await the cultists near the house.
One of the cultist is a vampire.
If players brought guards, one of the guards turns on them and turns out to be a cultist when they attack.
If players take the people out of the house and to a safe space, the cultists search the house and leave, but return the next night. If players aren't there to save them, they manage to kidnap the husband and the son.

    Encounter: Kidnapper Cultists
    Players             Enemies
    3                   1 Vampire Cultist, 2 Cultists 
    4                   1 Vampire Cultist, 3 Cultists
    5                   1 Vampire Cultist, 4 Cultists
    + Followers         Special (see description)

Players find out that the cult is seeking to _cure_ their master of his perils and is trying not to kill people, but kidnap them and force the curse upon them (or initiate them into the cult willingly). Cult members can transfer the curse from themselves to someone else. There are no more than 50 members.

(from Tony) He plans to infect everyone of a certain blood, allegedly their blood is the only type that works for all transfusions.

(❕) A player might be affected by the secret vampire and now has Vampirism
(❗) Their base is a dungeon cave to the north.
Also, they find a **black bead**










## The Mansion (Turning Back) (❗)
### If players are here for the first time...
Players meet Sedrik here. He explains that, with them, that makes it 584. Just 416 to go.
> Do you want to know? You must do a favor for me. I loved this house. But I would not step inside. It is not _my_ home anymore. Something is haunting it and preventing me from entering. _He tries to enter but vampires can only go inside if invited..._ Get rid of whatever is inside and I'll tell you what you want to know.
> I could do it myself, but I have better things to do
> Fair warning -- whatever is inside is not friendly
> ❗ Q: Curse powers?... There is a way to channel the curse marks. The lamp. Bring the lamp to my cult and they will show you how to use the curse marks.
If none of the players is unholy:
> Apologies for that, by the way. I instructed my Shades to only attack if they sense... a certain type of black magic. I don't know what happened there.
> My name is Sedrik by the way
> By the way [throws them a black bead] if you find out what this is, let me know.
If players ask him other things
> Clear the mansion first.
If players are annoying
> Watch your tone with me. Be thankful I'm letting you live.
If players attack him or keep disrespecting him, he strikes back, double-curses them, and vanishes soon after.
If players make it inside anyway, skip to **The Mansion (For Real)**

### Mansion Interior (❗)
House of a Lamia that is everpersent and can teleport.
The house can tell signs why Sedrik had so much money.

    Encounter: Rats
    Players             Enemies
    3                   3 Rats
    4                   4 Rats
    5                   5 Rats
    + Followers       + 1 rat / 2 Followers

    Encounter: Lamia
    Players             Enemies
    3                   1 Lamia
    4                   1 Lamia + 2 Minor Ghosts
    5                   1 Lamia + 4 Minor Ghosts
    + Mercenaries       + 1 rat / Mercenary

_Rose petals in a circle where the ritual took place._



At the end, Sedrik appears and thanks them.

If players are responsive to Sedrik, he will tell them his story:
> He was an occult investigator noble cursed with 1000 curses by an eldritch mage beacuse he dabbled in his affairs
> The only way to get rid of the curses is to transfer them to other alive people, 1 by 1. 1000 of them
> The curses don't allow him to stray too far from his place of rest
> The curse gets stronger the farther you go from Whispervale.
He wants them to help him destroy Mortessa: she is slowly draining the life of the townsfolk to keep herself alive and raising undead. I also don't know what she is planning, but she is raising undead... a lot of them.. All these Shades - they are his. I just repurposed them. I don't raise undead and I never will. It's inhumane.
❗ Before he was living here, Sedrik gathered a set of clues about where the lich is. The players must decipher the clues to find out his location.

If players ask other things
> I've already told you all you have to know.

If players are not responsive and act agressively.
> If you actually want to do some good, take a look upstairs, in the office. You have a bigger enemy than me.

if players want curse powers...
**If players have lamp.**
❗ Come back here in 2 days, at midnight.
**If players don't have lamp.**
❗ If you want to channel the powers of the curse, find the lamp and come back here in 2 days, at midnight.
**Switch to Peaceful Mansion.**

❗ If they find the accordion, it turns out it is actually a spell book!
**The book is in Draconic.**
_Prop: Accordion spell book._
Also, they find a **black bead**
LOOT: To Do

### Accordion Spell Book
Contains the spell Mortessa used to transform Sedrik into a vampire.
    _1000 curses = 1000 HP_

#### Bard's Accordion (❗)
The goblins ransacked my stash, so I had to hide them elsewhere in the forest.
There is a strange effect around town -- people age faster
Mortessa is draining the people around town... I can only guess why... (to keep herself alive)
> 85 years ago, an old lady visited the town. Very old and very frail.
> She was looking at the people in town with an awe... especially at the younger ones.
> I asked "Can I help you?"

> I replied "Yeah... but we all age don't we?"
> "Yeah... everyone should enjoy being young. People these days... age faster."
> Do they?
> They will soon.
She was never seen again.
> Ah, uhm, I found the accordion in the mansion, back in the day.
> Oh and uhm... I stole this from her.
LOOT: Ring - will help locating mortessa










## Old Graveyard (❗)
Journey to the old graveyard.
Inside the gravedigger's home is a journal that says the lamp is hidden somewhere.
> The lamp can be used for fast travel... but how?
> Many were lost when the fight with the vampire happened, and the lamp was broken. But what are these beads?
When players start to dig, they get attacked; enemies come every round. They must find a lamp in one of the graves.

    Encounter: Graveyard
    Modifier: Every round, if the players haven't found the lamp, a Minor Ghost spawns. Players can search graves with a Half-Action to try to dig for the lamp. They might find something else.

_Rose petals (teleport)_
❗ They can then return to the Druid.
Also, they find a **black bead**
**Switch to Druid's House Ransacked**










## Druid's House Ransacked (❗)
Her house is being ransacked by Vampire Cultists. She is not there.

    Encounter: Vampire Cultists
    Players             Enemies
    3                   2 Vampire Cultists
    4                   3 Vampire Cultists
    5                   4 Vampire Cultists

Players can notice a blue-shining note inside, that only they can see (sneak or fight mission).
Note says she in her hideout at the Named Loc-... (the letter ends abruptly).
- Players also find her written journal about how Mortessa made Riven beautiful and ever-young, and as such, Riven is in debt
❗ Find out more information about where the Druid is from the townsfolk.
- Riven doesn't know how to channel the curse
_If players wait..._
The cultist will just camp there and wait for her to show up.
If players leave and return later, they'll find the house looted, except for the blue-shining note.










## Riven's Escape Hut (❗)
Players find the Druid's hideout.
When players get to the Druid, they see her sending a raven away (she is secretly communicating with Mortessa).
Players find the Druid and they must protect her for X turns as she does the ritual.

    Encounter: Desecrator
    Modifier: Protect Riven
    Players             Enemies
    3                   Desecrator + 2 Mana Spawn
    4                   Desecrator + 2 Mana Spawn + 1 Shade
    5                   Desecrator + 2 Mana Spawn + 2 Shade
    + Follower          + Shade

Players gain **Felinar of the Shadow Realm**:
- Can transport them to the shadow realm, which acts as fast travel.
- Whenever a Unit with a Curse mark dies, the Felinar draws the curse inside it.
- For Half-Action, release all curses inside the Felinar releases all curses inside upon a Unit, dealing 10 Damage for each Curse expelled. Those curses can't be drawn back into the Felinar.

Riven wants to then show them something... he takes them to the cellar and reveals a kidnapped cultist.
She wants to destroy Sedrik. First, we would need to find out where he is and what he is weak to.
❗ Find the hideout of his cultists. Go there, find where he lives and what his weaknesses are.
❗ (if not done) While you're at it, I would appreciate to have my house back.

She offers to kill the cultist after he is interrogated ("because the vampire probably wants him to be alive. Plus, it would be a great opportunity to test out your new toy").

If confronted by players about Mortessa:

> Ancient Dome? Doesn't ring a bell. (truth)
> What business would you have with Mortessa?

If players insist, Riven will tell them about how Mortessa gave him this beautiful form, and in return, she just asked that he move closer to Whispervale and heal the villagers when they need it... because they will need it. She wants them alive.
    
If Riven senses they will go after Mortessa, he will try to stop them.
Riven can be convinced to let go of Mortessa, but she watches him. He will not help.
If players annoy Riven, he will attack.
If she dies, players can loot her hut and permanently learn some custom Spells.

    Encounter: Riven
    Players             Enemies
    3                   Riven

## Peaceful Mansion
**If players don't have lamp**
Nothing happens
**If players have lamp**
They are met by a cultist. He wants to show them how to use the powers and he wants to start a ritual inside the home.
They are attacked by Mortessa and her minions. They can either wait to protect him, defeat the undead, or flee with their lives.

If they turn on the cultist, he can reveal where their secret base is.
If they talk to Mortessa, she will spare them if they give her the lamp, but will not ally with them.

If the curse plan fails, Sedrik will meet them the next day and plan an attack on Mortessa to get the lamp back. The ritual can be repeated later at the mansion.

    Encounter: Mortessa at Mansion
    Modifier: Protect Tony and escape afterward
    Players             Enemies

The players are told to go to the other Cult Hideout B. They need to get him there.
They also want to plan a attack on Mortessa.







## Shadow Realm
Players meet Mortessa here, creating Shades from the souls of dead people (e.g. previous priest).
The Dementors are actually the restless souls of people who were killed, tricked or cursed by Sedrik and want revenge on Sedrik
_If other people died, use them instead._
Players can find other shadow realm markings around the world and recognize them and use them.

    TODO:


They have a device to destroy artefacts: Sedrik aims to destroy dark magic artefacts to power a certain type of device.

If players know about the Ancient Dome:
> The Ancient Dome is underneath Whispervale
If players don't know about the Ancient Dome:
> Sedrik's home is somewhere called the Ancient Dome, but nobody is quite sure where that is... except Mortessa.










## Cult Hideout (B)
Tower somewhere, gathering place, small camp.
> Sedrik aims to destroy dark magic artefacts so Mortessa can't have them...
> Once he is free, he will live a normal life and seek to destroy black magic... but at what cost... frankly I sense he might be coming after us.
> He has spent the past centuries learning non-occult magic










## Mortessa (❗)
Undead and the dragon.

> Mortessa wants to gather as many eldritch artefacts to become a lich and destroy Sedrik, then end the aura of drainage.
> She is currently sustaining her mind and body how he can (on devices).
> She is very old and her brain is out of memory.
> She stored some of her memories in **black beads**
> Mortessa raises the dead to protect herself agains the constant attacks of Sedrik
> Mortessa knew that eventually Sedrik would figure out a way to get rid of the curses, so she is keeping up a very large aura of anti-blood magic. Once Mortessa is dead, the aura is lifted and Sedrik's plan commenced.
> She doesn't know what Sedrik's plan is, but blood magic -- it's terrifying

If players know about the Ancient Dome
> The Ancient Dome... under Whispervale
If players don't know about the Ancient Dome
> She wants to take out Sedrik. Seek the Ancient Dome...
Then she dies and turns to ash.











## Ancient Dome
This is a large dungeon with multiple entrances that all lead to the same room in the center.

NPC's drop their house keys or special items.
For every NPC: If players threaten or kill them
Add extra incentives for players to go after Mortessa and Sedrik ("Heroes, we must go after Mortessa")

#### To-Do's
For each thing, do a "If players fail"
Side quests that tie to random encounters.
If an NPC has "If players do X..." have it as a quote that sends the GM to the subtitle.
