  Lore: An Order of the Curse member, who was given a special curse of vampirism and several Curse Marks by Lord Sedrik. With large wings, sharp claws and access to curse magic, the Vampire Cultist is a foe to fear. However, its power is diminished by Mortessa's aura - had it not been for the blocking of blood magic, the Vampire Cultist would possess incredible blood powers. How lucky...
